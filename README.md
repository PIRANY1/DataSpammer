# DataSpammer

This is the Beta Branch Of DataSpammer.
Logically this is the unstable Version.
Currently i am working on a tiny tiny rework to make the script more dynamic.
I am adding new call signs, finishing the api/arguments stuff, removing scoop and hopefully adding a jq native so i can have a very little footprint.
Also i am making everything a bit faster by removing cd scan stuff etc. and i am adding colors to make the script more visually appealing
