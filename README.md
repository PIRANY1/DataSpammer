# Error

## Fixing Errors 12, 13, 14
First, make sure all files (start.bat, install.bat, servercrasher.bat) are in the same Directory. 
If one of the Files is missing please redownload the Script. 

### Error Code 12
This means that the Script cant Start and you may have deleted the File after you opened it.

### Error Code 13
This is not that bad but you cant reinstall or delete the Script. It can work tho.

### Error Code 14
This means that the Main Script was deleted. 

## Fixing Errors 15, 16, 17
If you run install.bat it should be fixed

### Error Code 15
Installer probably didnt run or Settings.txt isnt existing
